# Phase 2 :

Our Prime Focus was Crime and Economic Vitality in South West DC in an attempt to find correlations as to why there could potentially be problems in the area and possible areas to concentrate.

Visualations in this phase are mainly geoplots of complete Washington DC and just Ward 6 to correlate Crime data with other parameters.
